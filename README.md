# GhostStory

Ghost Story allows you to write a story in markdown. The story can then be
read back to you. A ghost story is both text and automated scripts that will
type out code.

The initial use case is for composing repeatable screencasts. When you set out
to write a screencast you often times compose a script and the code that
accompanies it. There are some inherent problems with this manual method of
telling a story:

- Typing the code is cumbersome and error prone
- Removing errors and mistyping during the editing process is a waste of time
- Editing or updating your screencast later requires you re-create an entire section manually.

## Installation
